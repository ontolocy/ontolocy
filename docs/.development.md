# Developing Ontolocy

## Testing

We use pytest for testing.

Many tests require docker - you can use the included `docker-compose.yml` file.

```bash
docker-compose up
```

Run all the tests (stopping as soon as something fails):

```bash
pytest -x
```

Many of the tests require access to a neo4j instance. These are identified with the 'uses_graph' mark. We can skip these tests like this:

```bash
pytest -m "not uses_graph"
```

And check the coverage with:

```bash
pytest --cov=src/ontolocy
pytest --cov=src/ontolocy --cov-report=html
```

You can browse to the generated report at `htmlcov/index.html` or spin up a locally hosted version:

```bash
python -m http.server --directory htmlcov
```

## Linting

We use black for formatting.

```bash
black src
```

We sort imports with isort (in black compatability mode).

```bash
isort src
```

Then we double check with flake8.

flake8 config is defined in setup.cfg

```bash
flake8 src
```

We use pyre and mypy for double checking typing:

```bash
mypy src
pyre
```

Finally, we try to maintain some consistency of docstrings with pydocstyle:

```bash
pydocstyle src
```

## Documentation

The documentation is built with mkdocs.

NOTE: First you need to generate the model docs.

```bash
mkdocs serve    # see how the docs look during development
mkdocs build    # generate the documentation as a static html site
```

## Release

Increment the version, push to Github and upload to pypi!

```bash
git tag va.b.c
git push origin va.b.c
rm -rf dist
python3 -m build
python -m twine upload dist/*
```
